### Bindings

The Bindings provide a low level interface to work with your serialport. It is possible to use them alone but it's usually easier to use them with an interface.

- [`@serialport/bindings-cpp`](https://serialport.io/docs/api-bindings-cpp) bindings for Linux, Mac and Windows
- [`@serialport/binding-interface`](https://serialport.io/docs/api-bindings-interface) as an interface to use if you're making your own bindings
- [`@serialport/binding-mock`](https://serialport.io/docs/api-binding-mock) for a mock binding package for testing

## Developing

### Developing node serialport projects

1. Clone this repo `git clone git@github.com:serialport/bindings-cpp.git`
1. Run `npm install` to setup local package dependencies (run this any time you depend on a package local to this repo)
1. Run `npm test` to ensure everything is working properly
1. If you have a serial loopback device (TX to RX) you can run run `TEST_PORT=/path/to/port npm test` for a more comprehensive test suite. (Defaults to 115200 baud customize with the TEST_BAUD env.) You can use an arduino with the `test/arduino-echo` sketch.
